# What's this for?

There used to be [a really sweet macro](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2341717/can-you-do-a-runcustomtool-with-envdte-as-a-pre-build-event) for Visual Studio that would automatically run [T4MVC](http://t4mvc.codeplex.com) templates on build. Unfortunately, macro support has been removed from Visual Studio 2012, so this is an extension that will do the same thing.

I know [Chirpy](http://chirpy.codeplex.com/) and [AutoTT](https://github.com/MartinF/Dynamo.AutoTT) do the same thing, but Chirpy is overkill if all you want is your T4MVC templates built and AutoTT requires configuration.

# Installation

Just build and install the template using the VSIX file.
